Hi, it’s been a long time isn’t it? sorry to bother you. I don’t know if you read this or not but here i am wanting to deliver the last ounce of hope i have. 

It’s been 4 years since you left. truth to be told, none of the days passed by, i haven’t think of you. yes, i know this love is a sin and i willing to carry this sin to my grave. after you sent me the closure text, i self reflected a lot during those times. i don’t even know how can i love you this much. a lot of people said its attachment but then i dont thinks so because it’s the love that come from a heart. i will not do anything about it and i’m not even hoping you to come back even if “what if” always constantly in my mind. yes, i love you still and might be forever. i also know the love i have is not a sin until i do it with my action. i’m sorry if this love disgust you. 

i never regret to know you. my whole life, you are the only part of the book that i always turn back to every time. you are my comfort, my home. yes i broken inside, thanks to you, i’m learning a lot and more mature than my age. you are the turning point in my life. i cannot love anyone after you. i tried but i can’t. even if whole life i don’t have to be loved, i’m fine to live this life that carry the love i had for you. i don’t think i will ever unloved you. 

i’m sorry. i’m so sorry for everything i have done to you. yes, the guilt is still with me the same as i love you. i won’t bother you anymore. this will be the last. i hope you find a man that could take care of you and your family and could give the love i couldn’t. i want you to be happy. 

take care my love :)

regards,
cheri (bbg)
